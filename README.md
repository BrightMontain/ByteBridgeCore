# Deep core
This artificial intelligence model downgraded to byte to reach optimal perfomance as binary tripple power bound of bits: [000-111] = (2^3=8). 
The app is splitting the byte into 2 channels [8bit] = [2bit]*[4bit] and structed model can stable it.

# Bridge switch
Bridge could have a switch as controller with 
1. Static data to store its stable code
2. Virtual data to store its recent updates

# Getting started
To run this app
1. Create any blog page
2. Add any post form
3. Render posts on your blog page
4. Create AI model to split posts on your blog into source code and blog text
5. Create check tests with tags to make sure your AI is doing the same things as you
