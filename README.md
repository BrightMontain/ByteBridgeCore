# Byte bridge core
Byte is binary tripple power bit bound: [000-111] = (2^3=8). Let split the byte into 2 channels [8bit] = [2bit]*[4bit], So this bridge has right data array, left data array, line data connection, orbital data connection. Deep learning model can be built from this source:
1. Star map with tests and problems to solve generated by update bot from simple coin textures.
2. Brige deep learning model to distribute as a main AI project, which can run the PC and replace any other software or OS.
3. User account model for peer to peer trading components for bridge building, that will reduce the server overload and make the AI availiable for everyone.

# Bridge switch
Bridge switch can split the core into:
1. Dead part with classic books
2. Live part with recent news

# Deep bridge
AI have 5 main components to code:
1. Version control
2. Context data
3. Angle rebuild
4. Rating model
5. Optimization model
